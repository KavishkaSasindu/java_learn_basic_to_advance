---Stream API----

This help to process data efficiently using functional programming techniques.
help to do functional operations in Collection Interface (List,ArrayList,Set)

forEach() Method

Stream is basically is an interface

List<String> names = new ArrayList<Integer>();

we create a dynamic list to store name..then create a Stream object for it so using
stream object we can do anything to our list without affecting anything to it.

--creating stream object---

Stream<String> s1 - names.stream(); ** stream object can be used for only one operation in this example it is forEach


s1.forEach((name)->{
    System.out.println(name);
});

if you want another operation you can create a new stream object

Stream<String> s2 = names.stream();

    public void displayStreamObject() {
        s2.filter((name)->{
            return name.startsWith("K");
        });

        s1.forEach((name)->{
            System.out.println(name);
        });
    }


    to use map ----

    --> when you use map it will return a new stream

    s3.map((name)->{
        return name.toUpperCase();
    })
